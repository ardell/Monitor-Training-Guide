Monitor Training Guide
----------------------

This is a training guide for learning to run a sound check on a monitor console (sound board).

Purpose & Goals
---------------

One big reason that churches like Buckead Church get to work with such talented musicians is that they provide environments that talented musicians appreciate--such as a talented and trained monitor engineer.

Our goal as monitor guy:
1) Eliminating delays in sound check
2) Minimizing frustration in sound check
3) Running an organized and predictable sound check

Setup
-----

- Load a template for the board
- Find out what instruments (and channels) will be used that night
	- Who will be on vocals
	- Who will be running click & loop (typically drummer or keys)
	- How many lines of keys will you have (stereo vs mono)
	- Will guitars be stereo (pod) or dual mono (57/609 mics)
- Label the board with instrument names (inputs) musicians' names (outputs)
- For each input/output pair set reasonable defaults for:
	- Gain: their own instrument at 0db, others' at -10db
	- Pan: as it would sound to them without monitors
- Check input lines to make sure that they are patched correctly
	- Mics in particular
- Check monitor talk-back mic (your mic) to make sure everybody can hear it
- Set initial levels for channel faders (gains)
    - Gain all vocal mics at -10db (so they can hear each other during sound check, you'll bring them up to 0db later)
    - Raise channel faders (gain) for drums to 0db
    - Gain all other inputs at -infinity (all the way down; we will bring them up as we're ready for each instrument)
- Save initial configuration for today (DO NOT OVERWRITE THE TEMPLATE)
- Introduce yourself to the band
- Check pack batteries and distribute in-ear packs and ears
- Ask the band if they need anything
	- Patch cables, adapters, etc.
	- Is there any special setup for today? Auto-tune pedals hooked up to the board?

Sound Check/Rehearsal
---------------------

Notes:
	- Important to establish a predictable sequence: Drummer, Bassist, EG, Keys, Lead, BG Vox (see chart below)
	- Only break your order if something is waaayy too loud for someone (indicates probable error in set-up phase)
	- Certain musicians will be more picky than others--some want pan/EQ/gate set a particular way. Try to accommodate but if it slows the sound check significantly, request to move on.
- Start with the drummer: get his drum mix right in his own ears first
    - Have drummer play a groove (they will know to do this)
	- This typically requires a bit of tweaking
	- Others will request changes, ask them to please wait
- Next, ask the bassist if he wants tweaks for the drum mix, and tweak as appropriate; say "Drums to [bassist's name]", e.g. "Drums to Samm"
- Proceed in order, asking EG, Keys, Lead, BG Vox for tweaks on drums, e.g. "Drums to Matt" (EG), "Drums to Brad" (EG), "Drums to Scott" (keys), "Drums to Seth" (lead)
- Ask "any more changes on drums?" and tweak as appropriate
- Next, say "Bass to [Bassist's name]", and raise the bass master fader (gain) until bassist is happy
	- Once again, if others request changes, ask them to please wait unless it is waaayy too loud
- Say "Bass to [Drummer's name]", and tweak as appropriate
- Proceed, in order asking EG, Keys, Lead, BG Vox for tweaks on bass
	- They may request changes to drums at this time, if so go ahead and tweak, but maintain your order as much as possible.
- Continue in order of chart below, each instrument to themself first
- Keep eye contact with musicians during their rehearsal
    - They will request changes, especially at the beginning of their rehearsal and in between songs
- Save (overwrite) the previously saved session (NOT THE TEMPLATE!)
- Put the board in preview mode after rehearsal is finished, until just before show begins
- Just before the show begins, change batteries on all wireless mics (Lead Vox, BG/Other Vox, Host)

--- The Show ---
Sit back and relax.  As long as you have done a good job with setup and sound check, you should have very little to do during the show.

--- Troubleshooting ---
General sound check issues:
- If someone is late setting up (they have not arrived by the time you're ready to do sound check)
    - Run your sound check without them, then at the end bring their instrument in and get their tweaks separately
- If a particular input line is giving you a lot of trouble (not patched right, hearing strange noises over it)
    - Ask the Front of HouseÂ engineer, or wait until after you have sound checked other instruments then try to fix

Troubleshooting Drums:
- If the drums (particularly toms) are coming through quietly or they sound "far away", even though you have raised gain/channel faders
    - The gate is probably staying closed (effectively muting the drums)
    - First step *very important* is to lower the channel fader to -infinity (so we don't blow someone's ears out when we disable the gate)
    - Next, disable the gate
    - Finally, slowly raise the channel fader until the drummer is happy

Troubleshooting Guitars:
- Many guitarists (e.g. Kristian Stanfill Band) prefer only the 57 mic, not the 609.
    - Simply split out the stereo channels and mute the 609
